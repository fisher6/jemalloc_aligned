-------------------- ALIGNED JEMALLOC INSTALLATION NOTES ----------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that on the third line of ./src/jemalloc.c, there is the CUSTOM_ALIGNMENT 
marco which you need to change according to the desired alignment size (32/64)

Steps for configuring and building the library (replace 5 in 6 for 32bytes alignment):
- ./configure --with-lg-quantum=6 --with-lg-tiny-min=6 
- make
- make install

Then run the benchmarks with ENV_LD_PRELOAD and with vmStat as usual.

** If you get permission denied error during the ./configure stage, run
chmod -R u+x ./include/jemalloc , and run the steps for configuring from the start

------------------------------ ORIGINAL README --------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation that emphasizes
fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support.  jemalloc first came
into use as the FreeBSD libc allocator in 2005, and since then it has found its
way into numerous applications that rely on its predictable behavior.  In 2010
jemalloc development efforts broadened to include developer support features
such as heap profiling, Valgrind integration, and extensive monitoring/tuning
hooks.  Modern jemalloc releases continue to be integrated back into FreeBSD,
and therefore versatility remains critical.  Ongoing development efforts trend
toward making jemalloc among the best allocators for a broad range of demanding
applications, and eliminating/mitigating weaknesses that have practical
repercussions for real world applications.

The COPYING file contains copyright and licensing information.

The INSTALL file contains information on how to configure, build, and install
jemalloc.

The ChangeLog file contains a brief summary of changes for each release.
